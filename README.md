### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Rusdi
#### I am a developer
I have a passion for developing web applications, both professional and silly/meaningless web. Most of the projects that I make is either a product of boredom or school projects, period. I might have a serious project in the future, but who knows.

I have some experience dealing with mobile development using Kotlin, React Native, and Flutter/Dart. Out of those three, flutter is the one that I like the most and one that I have the most experience on.

I also have some experience in other languages too, such as:
- Python
- Java
- C#
- C++

Although, I must say that my experience in those languages are minimum.

Skills: HTML / CSS / JS / PHP / Laravel / NextJS / Dart / Flutter / Kotlin / React / Python
